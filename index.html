          I was born in the period of Reconstruction of Le Havre. 
          ln 1956 my parents found themselves being allocated a home which was well placed, 
          in the centre of town - and with a sea view! This was the ideal formula for a young 
          couple looking after four children and a grand-mother. Nevertheless we had to wait several 
          months until the standard of comfort in this flat reached a satisfactory level. 
          Indeed, the water supply often failed because of a lack of pressure; and we had to go down, 
          from the sixth floor, to the basement - although there was a lift - to fill up the buckets with the water 
          we needed for the day. we needed for the day. we needed for the day.

        The noise of the pile-driver and the horns of the steam-boats orchestrated 
        our afternoons at the Mailleraye school. ln the evening Mum would come to 
        pick us up, and we’d go for a bit of relaxation down at the beach. ln the 
        smaller port, at low tide, the smell of the slime would sometimes fill the air. 
        So, we would quickly slope off to the sea-wall where the smells of seaweed and 
        warm sand would welcome us.

          ln front of us lay the grey expanse of beach; to our left the Olsen sea-wall with 
          its fringes of rocks and, at the far end, the remains of a shipwreck. We’d take off 
          our clothes and run to the water where other kids were shouting and throwing water 
          over each other. The "biggies" would gather round large inner-tubes from which they’d 
          leap into the sea before coming back to grab hold of them and shake out their wet hair. 
          After that we would go foraging in the rocks, looking for little green crabs, which 
          were plentiful at that time, and would delight in bursting the iodine-filled vessels of 
          giant greeny-black seaweed. A whole swarm of children in bathing-trunks, some of 
          those trunks knitted, would be milling about at the base of the sea-wall, splashing in the 
          water left in the rock-pools.

        At the water's edge were some men equipped with a sort of plastic pouch, worn on their hips, 
        who were scraping at the sand with their "prodders", lifting them regularly to harvest 
        the grey shrimps trapped in their nets. They moved along the beach in this way, as far as the 
        breakwaters of Sainte-Adresse. The other favourite game consisted of building sand-castles 
        before the all-devastating tide came back in; and for the smallest kids the challenge of filling 
        the sand-castle moats with water!
        Preparing to go back, in the evening, we had to change behind the towel which Mum held up 
        in front of us, rinse out our bathing-costumes in a final move towards the sea-shore and wipe 
        our feet which were still covered with the sand which clung to them. Sometimes we had to 
        scratch them with some shingle, followed by more sand, trying to remove the dirty oil picked 
        up during our play and which stained our feet.

          lf we weren't going to the Chapeau de Napoléon, and if the tide-table allowed it, Sundays were 
          usually bathing days. The families would arrive with baskets containing the bathing-towels, 
          rubber rings and toys for the children; and the best organised brought parasols. There were children 
          everywhere, playing while their parents supervised them from a distance.

        Around the middle of 
        the afternoon the sweet-seller came along. You could hear his heavy foot-steps as he waded through 
        the shingle, and his call would put us on alert: pains chocolat, pains au raisin, coconut biscuits! 
        But usually we weren't buying anything from him, because we had our tea already catered for: 
        casse-croûte Rogeron [a local Norman speciality] and chocolate or buttered bread with chocolate. 
        The ice-cream seller also plied the beach on Sundays; but, for our part, we were going to be at Madame 
        Miko's; she lived on the ground floor of the building. Thus, without getting bored, we spent hours 
        with new discoveries, occasionally punctuated with small incidents.

          One afternoon my little brother slipped away from our parents' watch. The whole family, 
          in a state of turmoil, scoured the beach until we found the little "Toutounet" newly adopted 
          by another clan and tucking with gusto into the cake they had offered him. 
          Another time there was a piece of magic: a storm came in from the sea. We saw the sky cloud 
          over with grey and felt the wind rise up. Like a flock of panicking birds, all the 
          people on the beach broke away and ran. In our case, though, we had come that day with the 
          little wigwam my little brother had got for Christmas! So Dad, Mum, Marc and I took refuge 
          in this tent (which came with a ground-sheet); and we waited for the rain .... This seemed 
          like an extraordinary spectacle to us; and the pleasure of being in there, in the comfort of 
          that tent, the only ones protected from the storm, stays in my mind as an unforgettable moment.

        The years passed; and adolescence arrived. Friends of my parents acquired a cabin at the maritime baths. 
        lt was a classic cabin, an annexe of their home. The chip-pan took pride of place on the portable stove. 
        The family would eat there at mid-day as the father came back from work, took his dip in the sea, had a 
        rest and returned to the office, only to return at the end of the afternoon. That kind of pattern was 
        widespread at the time. A table, loungers and a two-seater canoe would complete the kitting-out of the cabin.

          We used to settle ourselves in, the younger generation arranging itself by age bracket. 
          In the morning, as one arrived, the first chore was to go to the drinking-fountain, turn 
          the lever and collect the water for the domestic needs of the day to come. We left out a 
          bucket of water in the sun, to be able to have a tepid shower later. We would go to this 
          water-fountain several times a day, to wash ourselves in soft water, to rinse out our bathing 
          costumes or simply to drink from the spout...

        Around the cabins the atmosphere differed from on the "public" beach. Everyone knew one another 
        and would meet up, year after year. Some of us stayed between the rows of cabins all af­ternoon, 
        only crossing the sand in order to bathe. For these cabins were raised on a pebbly part of the 
        beach. A major effort was needed to cross these rounded shingles without succumbing to the pain. 
        This was particularly so at the start of the season when everyone would be contorting their chests 
        seeking some balance, like a wonky puppet: but with a bit of practice we began to run without 
        feeling the pain at all.

          In front of the maritime baths, in the sea, there was also some wreckage; and many are the Havrais, 
          big or small, who remember their feet sinking into the soft sand which surrounded the metal parts 
          sticking out from this ship, and often getting wounded. As for me, this is where I learnt to swim. 
          One day, when I was bathing in the sea here, I felt this sensation of moving and of the metal bits 
          below my feet. I pulled them up quickly and went horizontal, fleeing this man-trap in an improvised breaststroke.

        So the cabins were often the meetingplace of for groups of young people for whom beach games were the 
        major activity of the summer. Volleyball teams were formed by the older ones; and the younger set were 
        admiring of their elders in all this, dreaming sometimes that their favourite boy or girl would cast a 
        glance in their direction! The awakening of amorous feelings would lead you to find the target of your 
        dreams on the beach, only for that one to be pursued and replaced the following year by someone newly 
        arrived or a regular who, during the winter, had been transformed into a butterfly.

          The beach was the location of the first kind of independence, even if it was still under the eyes 
          of the adults; the first emotional stirrings, the first meals taken in wooden-plank cafés, long 
          discussions, swapping and lending books and records .... So, growing up! With us, however, beach 
          times meant always time spent on the beach, not engaging in card games or aperitifs sipped with 
          cabin neighbours. Snippets of news exchanged, but not much more. Once we had undressed in the cabin 
          we would pick up our chairs and take them down to the water's edge. That way we kept our traditions 
          of the "people's beach".

        For the beach operated a very compartmentalised social hierarchy: at 
        Sainte-Adresse was the exclusive Régates et les Courlis Club where the Dionysian families gathered and 
        their young went to very sought-after bashes; then there was Galetville, more downmarket, with its maritime 
        baths where you could hire bathing costumes. The closer you got to the sea-wall the less prestigious were the social strata.

          When my parents' friends left Le Havre we bought their cabin; and as soon as it became possible 
          we moved to the first row, on the sea-wall side, because my father wanted to see the entrance to 
          the port with its constant movement of ships. The melting-pot nature of this location satisfied us. 
          There was a mixing of social groups, a diversity of cultures, with everyone preserving a personal 
          brand of belonging. Some people wore bathing costumes; others not: some came in groups of families, 
          with plenty of children running about, chattering and crying. One's gaze arrived sometimes on a 
          piece of sculpture; every colour was there, giving the place a simple quality of harmony and toleration. 
          This concoction led us, in those days, to call our neck of the beach "Abidjan Beach".

        And this is where we are still located today. The structure, which will soon be fifty years old, 
        is holding up well. Each generation follows on; and the baton is now held by the younger ones and their 
        children; but the games are the same. However, there's no more portable stove allowing you to have tea 
        facing the sea in September after a robust dip in the sea (that was the best!); no more canoes; no more 
        quality equipment, because robberies have become too common; no more sand, really! There still remains the 
        pleasure of bathing in the sea; of chips in cardboard boxes; of ice-creams melting in the sun; of light 
        reading and of the book left open, laid on the bathing-towel while you take big gulps from your bottle of water ...<br><br>

    The title of the book, which inspired this website, "Colours on the Beach", is connected to Karel Martens' large-scale commission 
      of the same name in Le Havre, France (2017), in which he devised a coded rhythm with 
      which to paint the traditionally white beach cabins that form a distinct part of the Le Havre’s cityscape.<br><br>
